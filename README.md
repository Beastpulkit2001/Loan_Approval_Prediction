# Loan_Approval_Prediction
Loan Approval Prediction is an automated process that uses machine learning to determine if a borrower is likely to repay a loan. By analyzing data—such as credit scores, income, and debt levels—the system predicts the risk of default and provides an instant "Approved" or "Rejected" decision.
